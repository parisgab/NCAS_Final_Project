# Project 2: Habitat Systems Concepts Studies

### __Air revitalization__
Starting with Dynetics, they are using a CO2 "scrubber" that will remove carbon dioxide and other indesireable gases from the environment of a space craft. It is small in design to decrease maintenance and logistical time. Mark Fisher says it can be used on spacecraft, compact space suits, and habitats.  

The Aerosol Sampling Experiment (provided by NASA Space Station Research Explorer) discusses how aerosols (dust, smoke, etc.) behave differently in microgravity than they do in Earth's atmosphere. To combat this, the ASE is a device that collects samples from the ISS cabin to return to Earth for analysis. The current understanding of aerosols in microgravity is limited, as the samples brought back from the ISS have either been handled incorrectly or not placed in collection substrates that can withstand extensive testing and microscopic analysis. The ASE consists of two samplers: the Passive Aerosol Sampler (PAS), which has 5 collection surfaces that are exposed for different durations of time; and the Active Aerosol Sampler (AAS), which has an internal pump and will collect samples for 6 hours on a single battery charge.
